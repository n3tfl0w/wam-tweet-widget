wam-tweet-widget
================

Simple widget written specifically for jekyll sites that displays a tweet this page widget after 20 seconds using css3 animations.

That time is configurable in the css3.

The idea for the widget was heavily inspired by the [Pickcrew.com Blog](http://blog.pickcrew.com), though the implementation differs.

Widget was built for [wordsandmagic.com](http://wordsandmagic.com) and can be seen in use there.
